So here we are bois, this is the final publication of my work. I hope you'll like it.

### UPDATE 10/12/2022
Adding handwritten digital notes to the bunch, updating them with time together with the sources. Obviously the sources will be behind the handwritten notes. At this exact commit the pdf files end when the handwritten notes start. Enjoy!

### UPDATE 05/04/2022 
I've begun developing the part of optics in electromagnetism.tex, it will need time but I'm pushing updates every time I write something new. I'm also studying for an exam in that subject so expect to see a lot of updates on that. The part on relativistic EM will be published sometime in the future when I'll manage to get some time, in the meanwhile enjoy those before I decide I fucking hate that part and I gotta rewrite it all in a single night. I'm open for suggestions or resources, if you have them.

## Ready to be Downloaded
* complete.pdf -> An Essential Mathematical Analysis Handbook
* qm.pdf -> Quantum Mechanics (QM, Atomic Physics, Quantum Chemistry, StatMech, Condensed Matter and some QFT) [QFT needs to be fixed I know, I will in my free time when EM is concluded]
* electromagnetism.pdf, beta version -> Electromagnetism; still misses the part on relativistic EM. I'm developing the part on optics. The final version will also have a small part on basic electric and magnetic circuits in the appendix.
* admech.pdf -> Advanced Mechanics and Special Relativity

## Appunti in Italiano, nella cartella /it
* astronomia.pdf -> Astronomia in Italiano, prof. O.Straniero
* mqmstmat.pdf -> Meccanica Quantistica/Statistica (Statistica incompleta, prof. Presilla), Struttura (prof. Postorino), in Italiano
* astrofisica.pdf -> Astrofisica in Italiano, prof. P. de Bernardis
* ifa.pdf -> Istituzioni di Fisica dell'Atmosfera in Italiano, prof. M. Cacciani

# Future Works
* Classical Thermodynamics (what if I place them as an appendix to the statmech part in the qm.pdf? That'd be... based? ðŸ˜³ )

## REMARK
This and all future works will be FREE OF CHARGE. You can download them whenever you want and how many times you want without ever worrying about them costing actual real money.

### UPDATE 22/02/2022
From now on this repository will be my main folder for notes, it will be way more active and not just when I decide to publish something, which is rare I must be honest. Commits will include edits, adds, unfinished work on notes I'm still writing, bullshit and everything, making it a better repo.
I hope you enjoy your stay here and my "secondary" job of writing this while relaxing from my real day job. Love you all, -MC
