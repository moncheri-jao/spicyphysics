# Spicy Physics
So here we are bois, this is the final publication of my work. I hope you'll like it.

If you really liked them and want to thank me with a coffee or a physical print of my works, you can send some cents here [in my paypal](https://www.paypal.me/birrabenzina)

# UPDATE 22 FEB 2022
From now on this repository will be my main folder for notes, it will be way more active and not just when I decide to publish something, which is rare I must be honest. Commits will include edits, adds, unfinished work on notes I'm still writing, bullshit and everything, making it a better repo.
I hope you enjoy your stay here and my "secondary" job of writing this while relaxing from my real day job. Love you all, -MC
