\section{Faraday's Law}
So far we managed to build four equations for the two fields, in \textit{static} conditions. These are, whenever there no dielectrics and no magnets, are
\begin{equation}
	\left\{\begin{aligned}
			\del_iE^i&=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\\
			\del_iB^i&=0\\
			\cpr{i}{j}{k}\del^jE^k&=0\\
			\cpr{i}{j}{k}\del^jB^k&=\mu_0J^i
	\end{aligned}\right.
	\label{eq:mwstatic}
\end{equation}
Faraday in his works had a major discovery while using two simple circuits.\\
Consider a closed circuit A with only a galvanometer, and a circuit B with a battery and a switch.\\
Using the switch for controlling the current flow on the circuit B (which is NOT connected to circuit A), he saw that the galvanometer measures a current while the current in B is changing.\\
Taking the same setup but keeping the switch closed on B, if either of the two circuits are in motion, there is current flow in A. The same happens if circuit B is substituted by a magnet!\\
Now take a non-rigid circuit immersed in a region with a constant magnetic field $B^i$. Deforming the circuit will also induce a current flow on it.\\
Calling $f_{em}$ the \textit{electromotive force} that drives the current in circuit A, Faraday deduced experimentally that
\begin{equation}
	f_{em}=-\dv{\Phi}{t}
	\label{eq:faradayneumann}
\end{equation}
Where $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux passing inside the circuit.\\
Note that we know, by definition, that this electromotive force must be driven by an electric field $E^i$, where
\begin{equation}
	f_{em}=\oint_CE^i_{ind}\hat{t}_i\dd l
	\label{eq:fem}
\end{equation}
This field \emph{can't} be conservative! Using the definition of the electric field as force per unit charge, and using Lorentz's force law we have a little hint that this induced field is the sum of a pure electric field plus a second field generated by the movement of charges
\begin{equation}
	E^i_{ind}=E^i+\cpr{i}{j}{k}v^jB^k
	\label{eq:faradayneumannindfield}
\end{equation}
Noting that the charges are constrained to the circuit, we can divide the velocity $v^i$ with a component parallel to the circuit $v^i_{\parallel}$ and a perpendicular component $v^i_{\perp}$. It's obvious then that
\begin{equation}
	f_{em}=\oint_C\left(E^i+\cpr{i}{j}{k}v^j_{\perp}B^k\right)\hat{t}_i\dd l
	\label{eq:femind}
\end{equation}
Suppose now that we do not move the circuit, then $v^i=v^i_{\parallel}$ and $E^i_{ind}=E^i$, where this electric field is for sure not conservative.\\
All this jargon, condenses itself in one simple but powerful law, \textit{Faraday-Neumann-Lenz's law}, which indicates exactly what Faraday discovered experimentally
\begin{thm}[Faraday-Neumann-Lenz, Electromagnetic Induction]
    Given a time-dependent magnetic field $B^i(t,x^i)$, an electric field is induced by the variation of its flux, where
    \begin{equation*}
        \oint_{\del S}E^i\hat{t}_i\dd l=-\dv{t}\iint_{S}B^i\hat{n}_i\dd s
    \end{equation*}
    Or, in its differential counterpart
    \begin{equation}
        \cpr{i}{j}{k}\del^jE^k=-\pdv{B^i}{t}
    \label{eq:fnldiff}
    \end{equation}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose that there is some circuit $\del S$ that spans some surface $S$ inside of it, which is immersed in a time dependent magnetic field $B^i(t)$, then \eqref{eq:faradayneumann} holds, and therefore
    \begin{equation*}
	\dv{\Phi}{t}=\dv{t}\iint_{S(t)}B^i(x,t)\hat{n}_i\dd s
    \end{equation*}
    The derivative on the right can be seen as the variation of the surface $S(t)$ when the $B$ field is fixed in time at $t_0$, plus the integral over the surface $S(t_0)$ of the derivative of $B$ with respect to time, i.e.
    \begin{equation*}
	\dv{\Phi}{t}=\dv{t_0}\iint_{S(t)}B^i(x,t_0)\hat{n}_i\dd s+\iint_{S(t_0)}\pdv{B^i}{t}\hat{n}_i\dd s
    \end{equation*}
    Since we know already that \eqref{eq:faradayneumann} holds, we have that if $f_{ind}$ is the induced $f_{em}$, we have that
    \begin{equation*}
	f_{ind}=\oint_{\del S(t_0)}E^i\hat{t}_i\dd l=\oint_{\del S(t_0)}E^i\hat{t}_i\dd l=\iint_{S(t_0)}\pdv{B^i}{t}\hat{n}_i\dd s
    \end{equation*}
    But
    \begin{equation}
        \dd\Phi=\iint_SB^i\dv{s}{t}\dd t=\int\oint_{\del S}\epsilon_{ijk}B^iv^j_{D}\hat{t}^k\dd l\dd t
    \end{equation}
    Where $v_D$ is the velocity in the direction of the movement of the circuit. Therefore, ``dividing'' by $\dd t$, we get
    \begin{equation*}
	\dv{\Phi}{t}=\dv{t}\iint_{S(t)}B^i(x,t_0)\hat{n}_i\dd s=\oint_{\del S}\cpr{i}{j}{k}\hat{t}_iv^j_DB^k\dd l
    \end{equation*}
    Since we know that an additional $f_{ind}$ is given by the deformation of the circuit $\del S(t_0)\to\del S(t)$, we have in total
    \begin{equation*}
	f_{em}=-\dv{\Phi}{t}=\oint_{\del S}E^i+\cpr{i}{j}{k}\hat{t}_iv^j_DB^k\dd l
    \end{equation*}
    Since $v_D=v_\parallel+v_\perp$ and $v_\parallel\parallel\hat{t}$ we get that since $\vec{E}_{ind}=\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$, $\vec{E}_{ind}$ has $\vec{B}$ as a source, and we can condense it all in a single integro-differential equation, which is Faraday-Neumann-Lenz's law
    \begin{equation*}
	\nabla\times\vec{E}\cdot\hat{\vec{n}}\dd s=-\dv{t}\iint_S\pdv{\vec{B}}{t}\cdot\hat{\vec{n}}\dd s
    \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
\subsection{Self-Induction}
Having deduced our previous results, the first thing that we might check is how a circuit behaves with itself.\\
Consider a closed circuit with some current $I(t)$ such that $\del_tI\approx0$. If the magnetic permeability of the body is constant we can apply Biot-Savart for evaluating the field, and we have
\begin{equation}
    B^i(t)=\frac{\mu_0I(t)}{4\pi}\oint_C\frac{\cpr{i}{j}{k}\hat{t}^jr^k}{r^3}\dd l
    \label{eq:bsautoind}
\end{equation}
Evaluating the flux of this field we have, since the current is independent from the integrated variables, that $\Phi\propto I(t)$, and therefore
\begin{equation*}
	\Phi(t)=LI(t)\qquad L=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\oint_C\iint_S\frac{\cpr{i}{j}{k}\hat{t}^jr^k}{r^3}\dd l\dd s
\end{equation*}
The constant $L$ only depends on the geometry of the circuit as it's easy to see from the integral, and it's known as the \textit{self-induction coefficient} or also as \textit{autoinduction coefficient}.\\
From Faraday's law, since this flux depends on time (through our current $I(t)$), it generates an electromotive force $f_L$, as follows
\begin{equation}
	f_L=-\dv{\Phi}{t}=-L\dv{I}{t}
	\label{eq:emforce}
\end{equation}
The autoinduction coefficient has units the following units:
\begin{equation*}
	[L]=\frac{[\Phi]}{[I]}=\frac{W}{A}=\frac{Vs}{A}=\Omega s=H
\end{equation*}
The SI unit $H$ is known as \textit{Henry} and it's equal to Watts/Ampere. Note that this can also be calculated via Ohm's law, noting that $V=RI$ and that $[RI]=\Omega A$
\subsection{Mutual-Induction}
Consider now a setup similar to the previous one, but with two circuits $C_1$ and $C_2$, which are close enough to each other such that the generated magnetic fluxes through each circuit are not negligible.\\
The fluxes as before will be proportional to the currents, and without evaluating the self-induction of both circuits we have
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\Phi_1(B_2)&=\iint_{S_1}B_2^i\hat{n}_i\dd s\propto I_2(t)\\
		\Phi_2(B_1)&=\iint_{S_2}B_1^i\hat{n}_i\dd s\propto I_1(t)
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:fluxescircuitsmind}
\end{equation}
Using the previous considerations, we have then, in index form, that
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_i=M_{ij}I_j(t)
	\label{eq:mutualind}
\end{equation}
The coefficients $M_{ij}$ are known as the \textit{mutual induction coefficients}. Obviously $M_{ij}=M_{ji}$
